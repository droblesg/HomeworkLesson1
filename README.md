# HomeworkLesson1
Homework from lesson one
I just got Visual Studio 2017 today in the morning, before I had Visual Studio 2015, and manage to do some part of homework 1 till today
I finished the first homework but didn't manage to fix the error, so I can't run test cases and check if is OK
I'm trying to do second homework
